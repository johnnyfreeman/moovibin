# Moovibin

A tool for helping me look through my DVD collection without actually having to get up off the couch.

## Project Goals

* Easily add movies. Use third party api to pull in movie data. So it should be as easy as type title of the new movie you just got for Christmas, api find all the info for you, save. Done.
* List all movies in a genre, for a director, with an actor, by rating, etc. or any combination (ex. list all PG13-rated movies from JJ Abrams). Think tags.
* Search for specific movie title (not incredibly important)
* That's it for now.

Here's a screenshot of the dashboard.html as it stands now (just tinkering).
